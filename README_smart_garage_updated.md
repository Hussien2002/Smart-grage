# Smart Garage

## Overview

The Smart Garage project is an innovative system designed to automate and enhance the functionality of a traditional garage. Using a microcontroller and various sensors, the system allows users to control and monitor their garage doors and other connected devices remotely. This project demonstrates skills in hardware integration, sensor interfacing, and embedded programming.

## Features

- **Remote Control:** Open and close the garage door remotely using an IR remote.
- **Sensor Integration:** Detects whether the garage door is open or closed using sensors.
- **Security Alerts:** Sends notifications if unauthorized access is detected.
- **Automated Lighting:** Turns on the garage lights when the door is opened.

## Technology Stack

- **Microcontroller:** Arduino or similar microcontroller.
- **Sensors:** IR sensors, flame sensors, LDR sensors, etc.
- **Communication:** IR for remote control.
- **Programming Language:** Arduino C/C++ for microcontroller programming.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hussien2002/Smart-grage.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Smart-grage
   ```

3. **Upload the Code to the Microcontroller:**
   - Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
   - Connect your microcontroller to your computer.
   - Select the correct board and port from the Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the code.

4. **Set Up the Hardware:**
   - Connect the sensors and other hardware components as described in the circuit diagram (if available).
   - Power on the microcontroller and test the system.

## Usage

- Use the IR remote to open or close the garage door.
- Monitor the status of the garage door (open or closed).
- Receive security alerts if there is an unauthorized attempt to access the garage.

## Future Enhancements

- **Voice Control:** Integrate voice commands using a virtual assistant (e.g., Google Assistant or Alexa).
- **Energy Monitoring:** Add energy consumption monitoring for connected devices.
- **Advanced Security:** Implement camera integration for real-time video monitoring.

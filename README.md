# Smart Garage

## Overview

Designed and developed an innovative smart garage system equipped with automated door control and an integrated smart fire alarm. The project aimed to enhance garage security, convenience, and safety by incorporating multiple advanced features. Additionally, it calculates the duration a car spends in a parking space and converts this time into a payable amount, aiming to improve parking management and streamline payment processes.
## Features

- **Remote Control:** Open and close the garage door remotely using an IR remote.
- **Sensor Integration:** Detects whether the garage door is open or closed using sensors.
- **Security Alerts:** Sends notifications if unauthorized access is detected.
- **Automated Lighting:** Turns on the garage lights when the door is opened.
- **Smart Fire Alarm:** Integrated fire alarm system for enhanced safety.
- **Parking Management:** Calculates the time a car spends in the garage and converts it into a payable amount.

## Technology Stack

- **Microcontroller:** Arduino .
- **Sensors:** IR sensors, flame sensors, LDR sensors, etc.
- **Communication:** IR for remote control.
- **Programming Language:** Arduino C for Arduino programming.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hussien2002/Smart-grage.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Smart-grage
   ```

3. **Upload the Code to the Microcontroller:**
   - Open the `smart_garage2.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
   - Connect your Arduino to your computer.
   - Select the correct board and port from the Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the code.

4. **Set Up the Hardware:**
   - Connect the sensors and other hardware components as described in the circuit diagram (if available).
   - Power on the microcontroller and test the system.

## Usage

- Use the IR remote to open or close the garage door.
- Monitor the status of the garage door (open or closed).
- Receive security alerts if there is an unauthorized attempt to access the garage.

## Future Enhancements

- **Voice Control:** Integrate voice commands using a virtual assistant (e.g., Google Assistant or Alexa).
- **Energy Monitoring:** Add energy consumption monitoring for connected devices.
- **Advanced Security:** Implement camera integration for real-time video monitoring.
